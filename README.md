### Lore:
Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg were childhood friends, sticking together all throughout their schooling until university. Taking their own paths, they pursued their dreams of building their own software companies. Over time, their rivalry grew, converting friendship into a gruelling hatred of one another. To put an end to this obstruction in their long-lasting friendship, they mutually agreed to battle it out in a hand-to-hand duel, that will decide their fates as company CEO’s. 
Elon decided to build robotic fighting gear, utilising the skills he learnt as a software engineer. This suit allowed him to be agile and quick, but his attacks were weak and slightly ineffective.
Mark on the other hand, went for the biologically enhancing route, brewing a potion allowing him to morph into a reptilian, which he was speculated to be throughout his time in university due to his nervousness. While as a reptilian, Mark had evolved to have greater strength, but is slowed down due to his build.
The winner of this battle would get full ownership over both companies, essentially owning the internet. The other would have infinite shame and humility, giving up their life’s work to their rival.
